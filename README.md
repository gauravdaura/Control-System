# Control-System
Prototyped an embedded system with digital and analog I/O peripheral including temperature sensor, Digital-to-Analog Converters (DAC), Real-Time Clocks (RTC), and Input/Output (I/O) expanders interfacing via I2C bus, user I/O including pushbuttons and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) module, and PWM motor control with quadrature encoder interface. Also, designed a 2-layer printed circuit board including symbols and footprints creation for the components, schematics capture, PCB layout and generated manufacturer deliverables files using Altium Designer for the prototype to develop a stand-alone system.
